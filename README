dpkg-repack - Debian package archiving tool

dpkg-repack creates a .deb file out of a debian package that has already
been installed on your system. If any changes have been made to the
package while it was unpacked (ie, files in /etc modified), the new
package will inherit the changes.

This utility can make it easy to copy packages from one computer to
another, or to recreate packages that are installed on your system,
but no longer available elsewhere, or to save the state of a package
before you upgrade it or make some other change that you fear may break
the package.
