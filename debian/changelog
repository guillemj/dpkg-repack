  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 12.
  * Remove dpkg-dev Build-Dpends, satisfied in oldstable.
  * Remove Documentation::RequirePodLinksIncludeText perlcritic suppression.
    The test was bogus and has now been removed from perlcritic.
  * Configure Getopt::Long with «posix_default bundling_values no_ignore_case».
  * Remove backwards compatibility workaround for libdpkg-perl < 1.18.2,
    satisfied in oldstable.
  * Surround replacement names with <> in --help output.
  * Refactor package archival into a new Archive_Package() function.
  * Use a block eval to trap errors from Archive_Package(), so that we will
    detect any errors not just the ones coming from Error() calls.
  * Switch SafeSystem to use Dpkg::IPC::spawn().
  * Switch to Dpkg::ErrorHandling reporting functions. We do not need the
    ad-hoc implementations anymore for problem reporting, and can use the
    ones in libdpkg-perl. Even though they are private, because this is a
    sibling project, we can cope with the lack of interface guarantees.
  * Update copyright years.

  * Use the provided pkgname when calling dpkg commands, instead of partially
    reconstructing it from metadata, as we might end up not matching the same
    arch-qualifying the user specified. Closes: #870724
  * Use Dpkg::IPC instead of qx() or open() subcommand pipe support. This will
    give more accurate error messages and will check all function return codes

    older versions of dpkg-repack packed up not the original file, but the

dpkg-repack (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Uses dpkg for querying the status file and getting the file list, rather
    than doing it by hand. However, dpkg-repack still accesses the dpkg
    database directly, because it copies maintainer scripts, etc, from
    there. There is no way to get that information via dpkg.
  * Fixed  bug #22603 - a failure when eg. /usr is a symlink.
    .
    If the package contains a file, that locally looks like a symlink
    pointing to a directory that is not in the package, then change it to a
    real directory in the repacked package. This assumes that in this case,
    the symlink was a local change (eg, /usr is a symlink).
    .
    However, if the directory in question contains no files in the filelist
    for this package, don't do that, just preserve the symlink in the repacked
    package. This handles the case where a package contains a symlink to a
    directory elsewhere.

dpkg-repack (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't include file list file in package. (Removes "contained list as info
    file" error from dpkg when you install dpkg-repacked packages.

dpkg-repack (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force the umask to 022 (#14516).
  * Use debhelper.
  * Be a bit more positive that the package will work in the description,
    since it seems to have worked pretty much ok for a year.

dpkg-repack (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Fixed binary-indep target.

dpkg-repack (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved it into unstable.
  * Changed the program so it puts its temporary directory and the result
    .deb file into the current directory, instead of /tmp. This is the same
    as alien works, and I made this change mainly so you can repack some
    large package on a spare partition when it won't fit on the partition
    that contains /tmp.
  * Added --root=<dir> option, to make it operate on the filesystem rooted at
    <dir>.
  * Remove temporary directory when done.
  * Man page fixes.
  * Added proper error trapping and handling.
  * Added progress messages.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Run dpkg-gencontrol after debstd, and delete substvars during clean.

dpkg-repack (0.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fixed problem with packaging dangling symlinks.

  * Add Architecture: field to the control file.
  * Removed some debugging info that was left in by mistake.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Run dpkg-gencontrol after debstd, and delete substvars during clean.

    in experimental.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Mar 1997 01:59:04 -0500

dpkg-repack (0.4) unstable; urgency=low
